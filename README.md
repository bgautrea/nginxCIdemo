# NGINX CI Demo Repo

This repo provides an implementation of an repository that is connected to a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) workflow that will test and update a NGINX configuration [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com).

## What is CI/CD?
A Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery platform allows for a system to be pushed, typically through a set of workflows that will allow it to:
* Provide a version control
* Integrate with a testing strategy:
    * Uses x, y and z.
* allows for approval workflows
* Can push from QA to Staging to Test and finally production
